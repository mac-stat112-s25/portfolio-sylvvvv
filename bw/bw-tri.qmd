Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}

library(ggplot2)

# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)

#from exercise muiltivariate
ggplot(education, aes(x=salary, y=sat, color=expend)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")



```
