Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
fbicrime <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-02-18/agencies.csv")

library(ggplot2)

#from hw3, fbicrime
ggplot(fbicrime, aes(x = is_nibrs, fill = agency_type)) +
geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~agency_type) +
  labs(
  title = "Plot of FBI Agencies' Crime Rate",
  caption = "Sylvie L."
  )


```
