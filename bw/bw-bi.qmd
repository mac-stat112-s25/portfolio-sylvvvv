title: "Bivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
# Load data
elections <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv")
library(ggplot2)

# Check it out
head(elections)


ggplot(elections, aes(y = median_rent, x = repub_pct_20)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age (from the bi exercise)
ggplot(elections, aes(y = median_age, x = repub_pct_20)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
