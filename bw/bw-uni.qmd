title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")

# from uni excercise
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue")  +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes") + 
  theme_minimal()
```
