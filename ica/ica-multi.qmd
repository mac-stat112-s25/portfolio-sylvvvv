## Exercises (required)

### The story {-}

Though far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state's education system. The `education` dataset contains various education variables for each state:

```{r}
# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```

A codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/SATcodebook.png)


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Import data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  

# Check out the first 6 rows
# What are the units of observation?
head(weather)

# How many data points do we have? 
nrow(weather)

# What type of variables do we have?
str(weather)
```


### Example 1 {-}

```{r}
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm)) + 
  geom_density()
```


### Example 2 {-}

```{r}
# Plot 1 (no facets & starting from a density plot of temp3pm)
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# Plot 2 (no facets or densities)
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = location)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
# Plot 3 (facets)
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~ location)
```


### Example 3 {-}

```{r}
# How often does it raintoday?
# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "blue")
```

```{r}
# If it does raintoday, what does this tell us about raintomorrow?
# Use your intuition first
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = raintomorrow))

ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# Now compare different approaches

# Default: stacked bars
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# Side-by-side bars
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

```{r}
# Proportional bars
# position = "fill" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill
ggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

### Example 4 {-}

```{r}
# THINK: What variable goes on the y-axis?
# For the curve, try adding span = 0.5 to tweak the curvature
ggplot(woll, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(span = 0.5)
```

```{r}
# Instead of a curve that captures the general TREND,
# draw a line that illustrates the movement of RAW temperatures from day to day
# NOTE: We haven't learned this geom yet! Guess.
ggplot(woll, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date)) + 
  geom_line()
```

### Example 5 {-}

```{r}
# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am
# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds
# AND identify the days on which it rained / didn't raintoday
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ raintoday)

```

```{r}
# How many ways can you think to make that plot of temp3pm vs temp9am with info about location and rain?
# Play around!

ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am, color = location, shape = raintoday)) + 
  geom_point()
```

### Example 6 {-}

```{r}
# Change the code in order to construct a line plot of temp3pm vs date for each separate location (no points!)
ggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date, color = location)) + 
  geom_line()
```

### Example 7 {-}

```{r}
# Plot the relationship of raintomorrow & raintoday
# Change the code in order to indicate this relationship by location
ggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
  facet_wrap(~ location)
```


### Exercise 1: SAT scores {-}

#### Part a {-}

```{r}
# A histogram would work too!
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) + 
  geom_density()
```

#### Part b {-}

average SAT scores range from roughly 800 to 1100. They appear bi-modal.


### Exercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries {-}

#### Part a {-}

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs expend
# Include a "best fit linear regression model"
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs salary
# Include a "best fit linear regression model"
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

#### Part b {-}

The higher the student expenditures and teacher salaries, the worse the SAT performance.


### Exercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending *and* Teacher Salaries {-}

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


### Exercise 4: Another Way to Incorporate Scale {-}

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

States with lower salaries and expenditures tend to have higher SAT scores.


### Exercise 5: Finally an Explanation {-}

#### Part a {-}

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

#### Part b {-}

The more students in a state that take the SAT, the lower the average scores tend to be. This is probably related to self-selection.

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

#### Part c {-}

When we control for the fraction of students that take the SAT, SAT scores *increase* with expenditure.

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

#### Part d {-}

Student participation tends to be lower among states with lower expenditures (which are likely also the states with higher ed institutions that haven't historically required the SAT). Those same states tend to have higher SAT scores because of the self-selection of who participates.


### Exercise 6: Heat Maps {-}

#### Part a {-}

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Remove the "State" column and use it to label the rows
# Then scale the variables
plot_data <- education |> 
  column_to_rownames("State") |> 
  data.matrix() |> 
  scale()

# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps
library(gplots)

# Construct heatmap 1
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "none",
  Rowv = NA, 
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Construct heatmap 2
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "none",
  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

```{r fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Construct heatmap 3
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "row",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM "none" TO "row"
  Rowv = TRUE,            
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

#### Part b {-}

-   Similar values in verbal, math, and sat.
-   High contrast (an inverse relationship) verbal/math/sat scores and the fraction of students that take the SAT.
-   Outliers of Utah and California in ratio (more students per teacher).
-   While grouped, fraction and salary are not as similar to each other as the sat scores; it is also interesting to notice states that have high ratios have generally low expenditures per student.


### Exercise 7: Star Plots {-}

#### Part a {-}

MN is high on the SAT performance related metrics and low on everything else. MN is similar to Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, the Dakotas...

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 20}
stars(plot_data,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),
  cex = 1, 
  draw.segments = TRUE
)
```

#### Part b {-}

When the states are in geographical ordering, we'd notice more easily that states in similar regions of the U.S. have similar patterns of these variables.

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
stars(plot_data,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location
  key.loc = c(-110, 28),
  cex = 1, 
  draw.segments = TRUE
)
```
